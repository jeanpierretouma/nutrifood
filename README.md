## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- Navigate the page via a navigation menu
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- jQuery

### What I learned

I learned how to make a sticky navigation bar and a mobile navigation bar with vanilla JavaScript by using JavaScript to toggle on and off classes in CSS to apply the stylings once the conditions are met.

### Continued development

This project is complete in terms of functionality and looks but it needs some animation effects which will be implemented later.

Another feature that I'll implement in this project is JS form validation to increase the security and interaction of the contact form of the landing page.
